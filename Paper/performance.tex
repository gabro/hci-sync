\section*{Performance evaluation}
In this section we now present the different performance measures adopted to evaluate the goodness of our goals.

\subsection*{Experiment 1 - \testfirst}
In this test we want to measure the \emph{regularity} of the sequence of taps performed by the user. Moreover it is interesting to measure also the frequency synchronization w.r.t. the given beat and the \hl{``normalized'' synchronization}. \todo[color=yellow,inline]{Find a better name for this}
Let us now see how we defined such measures.
\subsubsection*{Regularity}
We refer to regularity as the mean squared error of the intervals between each user's tap.
The lower the error the better the regularity.

It's worthy to notice that the regularity could be non correlated to the synchronization, in the sense that a user could produce a very regular sequence but still not be synchronized with the provided soundtrack.
