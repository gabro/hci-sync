\section{Future development}
As we have seen so far we managed to synchronize the execution of a trivial task with a specific background music. An interesting development would be to investigate whether such behavior can be reproduced with different BPMs and if so at which extent.

For instance we noticed that users synchronize to a 130 BPM tempo while performing the BalloonTapper activity, but we don't know whether they would to the same with a faster or slower tempo.

It is likely that there may exist one or multiple windows of BPMs for which a human subject tend to synchronize with the background music tempo, but it clearly needs to be extensively tested with actual data.

Setting the bounds of the effect we highlighted in this paper could help in applying it to real life situation, in which, as stated in the \nameref{sec:framing} Section, may be useful to enforce a slower or faster behavior, e.g. in as video-games and work environments.
